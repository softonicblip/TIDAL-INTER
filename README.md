# TIDAL-INTER (work in progress)
### warning: noob/old css, also not polished
> todo: broken/buggy horizontal player (hardcoded rn), fix line height when a lyric is too long

css directly imported from [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/21263) and slightly modified to work on [TidaLuna](https://github.com/Inrixia/TidaLuna)
